Here are some of the highlights from Melbourne, as chosen by renowned technical analyst and illustrator Giorgio Piola\\u2026\\n\\nHaas VF-17 - shark fin modifications Haas were forced to remove their T-wing after first practice because it was causing excessive vibration and movement in the shark fin attached to the car\\u2019s engine cover. Keen to reinstate it in time for qualifying and the race, the team added carbon-fibre reinforcements (red arrow) to the fin in order to make the whole assembly stiffer.\\n\\nRenault R.S.17 - rear wing pick-up point change In pre-season testing Renault had the pick-up point of their rear wing pillar attached directly to the top of the DRS actuator (inset, red arrow). At first this looked like a very trick solution, but then fears surfaced that it could provide an illegal advantage in terms of the wing\\u2019s performance. This prompted a modification, retained for Australia, with the pillar instead attached lower down to the actuator mounting\"\n",
